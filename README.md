My name is Victor Asael Corona Galan. I go by Asael. <br>
I am a Computer Science student at SCSU. 
I'm currently working on building a portfolio since I would like to become a full stack developer.
I have worked with Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python. As of right now I am working on learning some frameworks such as bootstrap
(currently learning Bootstrap 4 since I learned version 3.4.1 first), how to use asynchronous Javascript on my websites and 
how to be more profficient in CSS. <br>
Thanks for checking and good coding!
